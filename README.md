# Hospital Readmission Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It uses patient data such as age, vitals, comorbidities, and discharge destination.

## Key Features
Preprocessing of mixed data types (numerical, categorical, binary)

Handling class imbalance using SMOTE

Model training using Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Ready for deployment in a hospital environment

## Workflow Overview
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

SMOTE for class balancing

Model Training & Evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning

Deployment Preparation

## To Run the Project
Load the dataset: hospital_readmissions_30k.csv

Run the Jupyter notebook or script

Outputs include confusion matrix and performance report
